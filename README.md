# odin-recipes

This is my first TOP project website. I am going to make a recipe website for the HTML section of the Foundations path.

This project will help me to better understand how to use HTML to create a website by having a homepage, linked (relative path) pages, and inserting images.

I will be able to:
 - Write the HTML boilerplate
 - Include at least lists, links, and images
 - View the wesbite on a browser
 - Only use the terminal to create files and launch programs

I am excited to do this!
