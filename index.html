        <h1>General Tsos Chicken <a href="./recipes/general-tsos-chicken.html"></a></h1>
        <p>This is a great recipe for any night of the week.  It is easy to make and tastes amazing.</p>

        <h1>Sweet and Sour Chicken <a href="./recipes/sweet-sour-chicken.html"></a></h1>
        <p>This is a wonderful alternative to General Tsos.  It is a little less spicy but just as tasty.</p>

        <h1>Fried Rice <a href="./recipes/fried-rice.html"></a></h1>
        <p>No meal would be complete without a great side and this rice will not dissapoint even the pickiest of palates.</p>
