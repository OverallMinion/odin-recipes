            <li>Place rice in a large mixing bowl, add eggs, and toss together.</li>
            <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Dump rice mixture into the hot pan. Add sesame seeds, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Taste and add more butter or soy sauce as desired. Serve.</li>
